        <h1>coloring svgs in flutter</h1>

        <p>
          while using svgs in your app, you may be tempted or obliged to use
          multiple, differently colored versions based on your app's theme. in a
          case like this, if your svg file consists of a single color or
          element, it is easy to get the job done. however, if your svg file
          consists of multiple paths with various colors; strokes, and different
          stroke colors, it becomes a bit more complicated.
        </p>

        <p>
          i will try to ease your job a little by showing you how to color it
          programmatically.
        </p>

          package is mainly used to draw vector graphics in flutter. so, i will
          give my example on that. i have the below graphic to use on my app:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./assets/images/blog/flutter/svg_color_mapper/file.png"
          alt="file icon, which consists of a folder and a plus sign. border and the plus sign is black, folder is yellow"
        />

        <pre>
<code class="hljs language-xml">&lt;svg width="62" height="62" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
    &lt;path d="M9.5 8V5.5H19.5V18.5H4.5V8.5H9C9.27614 8.5 9.5 8.27614 9.5 8Z" fill="#E7CA62"
        stroke="black" stroke-linejoin="round" /&gt;
    &lt;path d="M15 12V16M13 14H17" stroke="black" stroke-linecap="round" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code>
</pre>

        <p>
          notice that it consists of 2 paths: file and plus sign, stroke for the
          file path and different colors for path and strokes. package
          contributors provided a way to substitute the colors while the svg is
          parsing so you can change the color dynamically.
        </p>

        <h2>color mapper</h2>

        <p>achieved by below:</p>

        <pre>
<code class="hljs language-dart">SvgPicture(
    SvgAssetLoader(
        'assets/svg/file.svg', // your file path
        colorMapper: FileColorMapper(),
    ),
),</code></pre>

        <p>
          <b>filecolormapper</b> is a class extending the
          <b>colormapper</b> (provided by the package). which then, we can
          override its substitute method to manipulate colors on the svg.
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="hljs language-dart">import 'package:svg_color_mapper/custom_color_mapper.dart';

class FileColorMapper extends ColorMapper {
    const FileColorMapper();

    @override
    Color substitute(
    String? id,
    String elementName,
    String attributeName,
    Color color,
    ) {
    return color;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          id, elementname, attributename, color is populated by the svg file.
          you can write your own logic to manipulate the color based on these
          values. in this case, i am returning the color as is.
        </p>

        <p>remember the svg file:</p>

        <pre>
<code class="hljs language-xml">&lt;svg width="62" height="62" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
    &lt;path d="M9.5 8V5.5H19.5V18.5H4.5V8.5H9C9.27614 8.5 9.5 8.27614 9.5 8Z" fill="#E7CA62"
        stroke="black" stroke-linejoin="round" /&gt;
    &lt;path d="M15 12V16M13 14H17" stroke="black" stroke-linecap="round" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</code>
</pre>

        <p>
          here, you see the fill color for first path (the folder part) is
          #e7ca62<span class="color-box bg-yellow-500"></span>. so if i were to
          paint this part as orange, i would update the substitute method
          accordingly like below:
        </p>

        <pre>
<code class="hljs language-dart">import 'package:svg_color_mapper/custom_color_mapper.dart';
    
class FileColorMapper extends ColorMapper {
    const FileColorMapper();
    
    @override
    Color substitute(
        String? id,
        String elementName,
        String attributeName,
        Color color,
    ) {
        if (color == const Color(0xFFe7ca62)) {
        return Colors.orange;
        }
        return color;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>and the result becomes this:</p>
        <img
          src="./assets/images/blog/flutter/svg_color_mapper/updated_file.png"
          alt="updated file with orange color for folder, which was yellow"
        />

        <p></p>
        <h2>complex coloring</h2>

        <p>
          updating the color based on design color is one thing, but if you find
          yourself in a situtation where you need to do extensive changes on the
          svg, just ask your designer to design more icons and let them earn
          those big bucks. or, at the very least, ask for them to put an id to
          all the elements. so you can easily manipulate the colors by using
          ids.
