        <p class="blog-text">
          i have been working on a project where i need to color svg images
          dynamically. i have tried to use the color_filter package but it did
          not work as expected. i have also tried to use the svg package but it
          did not work as expected either. i have finally found a way to color
          svg images dynamically and i would like to share it with you.
